# Text Adventure

### What is this?

A text adventure game written in [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/)!

### ...but why?

Why not? I'm a huge fan of doing more with less, and about the best way to do that on the web is to not import any JavaScript libraries at all! I do import Bootstrap for styling purposes, but that's it.

### Sure, but... this would be so much easier with Angular / React / TypeScript / jQuery / (insert thing here)

Great! If you like using one of those, feel free to make your own version of this and share it; I'd love to see it! Some of those I even plan on doing myself:

-   TypeScript - coming soon
-   Angular - coming soon
-   [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) - coming soon

### So... how do I play?

I'm so happy you asked; it's simple:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcgrewgs/text-adventure-vanilla-js
open text-adventure-vanilla-js/index.html
```

I hope you enjoy the references as much as I did.
